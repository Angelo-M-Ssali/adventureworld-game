🏹 AdventureWorld: Hunger Games Arena
Text-Based Adventure Game built with Python (CS 111 – University of Illinois Chicago)

**🎮 Overview**
AdventureWorld: Hunger Games Arena is a Python-based, text-driven survival game inspired by Hunt the Wumpus and The Hunger Games. Players explore a 20-district arena generated by the AdventureWorld framework, collect critical items, avoid hazards, and attempt to capture the elusive Victory Token to win.
The game emphasizes logic, randomness, and player decision-making, challenging users to navigate uncertainty using clues and limited resources.

**⚙️ Features**
Randomized World Generation: 20 interconnected “districts,” each with unique connections.
Hazards & Events:
Deadly traps instantly end the game.
Disruptive hazards teleport the player and remove inventory.
Tools & Inventory:
Arena Map 🗺️ – reveals the full district layout and token location.
Capture Device 🔧 – detects nearby treasure and enables capture attempts.
Treasure Mechanics:
The Victory Token 🏆 relocates after failed capture attempts (50 % success rate).
Immersive Feedback: Contextual warnings, clues, and ASCII-style interface.
Replayability: Random hazard and treasure placement ensure every run feels new.

**🧠 Skills Demonstrated**
Python Programming & OOP – modular functions, data structures, state management.
Algorithmic Thinking & Problem Solving – hazard logic, detection radius, randomization.
Debugging & Iterative Design – tested multiple win/lose conditions and feature branches.
User Experience Design – clear text prompts, dynamic feedback, and decision flow.
